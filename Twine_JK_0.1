For the past couple of nights she has been hearing strange noise from the apple orchard. Also, she observed, that the apple trees didn't look as fresh and happy as they used to. \u000aYou notice a sort of resigned undertone in her voice and immediately realize that there is more to it.\u000aYou grab your bike and get going.\u000aOnce you arrive you check the time and see that the handles say 6:15. But is it [[day]] or is it [[night]] time?
